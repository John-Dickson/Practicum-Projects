# Practicum Projects
These are the projects I completed during the course of my study at Practicum. 
- Gold Project: 
	- The project is complete, the code needs to be revised and cleaned up a little, but everything functions correctly.
	- Add `clear_output(wait=True)` to the appropriate places in the code to make the output cleaner. 
- Final Project: 
	- The project is complete. The goal of the project was to achieve a AUC-ROC score of at least 0.85 on the machine learning model.
